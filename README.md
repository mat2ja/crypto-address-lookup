### App to check your crypto balance in real time

Made in its entirety by me (before I knew what I was doing)

Fetches your balance from the blockhain, converts the value to dollars, and tells you the latest info about that specific coin. I like it.

EDIT: 
        Seems like something with the api is broken now, getting CORS 403 Forbidden :(
        So I had to disable pricing data for now
        Will rebuild entire app with Vue/React anyways, and do it properly
