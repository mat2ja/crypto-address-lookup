### App to check your crypto balance in real time

Made in its entirety by me, vanilla js (before I had any clue what I was doing)

Fetches your balance from the blockhain, converts the value to dollars, and tells you the latest info about that specific coin. It was cool at the time.

EDIT: 
Seems like something with the api is broken now, getting CORS 403 Forbidden :(, so I had to disable pricing data for now.

Will probably rebuild the app with Vue/Svelte anyway, and do it properly
